            <p2>Oblivion itself is one section of Aurbis- the name given to the entire universe in the Elder Scrolls- specifically for the deities (Et'Ada, as they are called within the series) who did not wish to take part in the creation of Mundus.- though two exceptions exist for that. As such, the realm is incredibly important to the lore and story of the games- especially the fourth installment, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, being the namesake for the title. The realm is metaphysically connected to Mundus, and by extension, Nirn- the planet the games take place on. This metaphysical connection meant nothing to the gods until the beginning of the time period known as the "First Era" in the lore- where the Aedra, another faction of gods, made a pact with Alessia, a mortal queen, to erect magical barriers to stop Daedra entering the world- unless summoned by a mortal. These barriers have waned through the later Eras, but as a rule of thumb are the reason Daedra aren't as common on Nirn as expected.- only summoned via conjuration magic, or communed with via shrine.</p2>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Oblivion is split up into various sub-realms, controlled by a master who is usually a Daedric Lord- though there are exceptions to this. When talking about the sub-realms, it gets very confusing. "Oblivion" as a whole is simply part of the grant universe of Aurbis- and is nothing more. Consider Oblivion to be parallel to the Solar System, and the various realms to be the planets of that solar system- as numerous as they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
    
        <div>
            <h2 id="Greater">The Realms of Oblivion- Greater</h2>
            <p1>The Greater Realms are all directly connected to a Daedric Lord- and represent the personality, sphere and aspects of said Prince, in one way or another.</p1>

            <h3 id="Moon">Moonshadow</h3>
            <p3>Moonshadow is a realm that has yet to be directly shown within the universe- though it has been described. Moonshadow is the realm of Azura and is described as a twilight vista of shades and half-thoughts. The land contains many gardens of roses, a city of silver, and waterfalls- where colours blur together, instead of being distinct. Azura herself resides in a palace of roses, and any mortal entering the realm is rendered half-blind, due to the beauty of the place.</p3>

            <h3 id="Share">Attribution's Share</h3>
            <p4>Attribution's Share is the realm of Oblivion ruled over by Boethiah. The realm is repeatedly renamed by it's patron- and was previously known as Snake Mount, though in the current age of the lore, it is Attribution's Share. The layout is a vast maze, and twisted towers, where one would be constantly lost. Within the Elder Scrolls 4, you enter Attribution's Share during one of the quests- for a tournament it's patron is hosting. The Tournament of Ten Bloods is a tournament in which a champion from each living race is placed in a fight to the death, and the victor is granted Goldbrand- one of Boethiah's artifacts.</p4>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/attribution.png" alt="an image of attributions share"></div>
            <h3 id="Regret">The Fields of Regret</h3>
            <p5>Rules over by Clavicus Vile, the Fields of Regret appears like a idyllic countryside, with various cities perfect for a merchant- however, the air is heavy with the scent of both perfune and rotting flesh. The clouds are fluffy- yet streaked with a sickly green that ruin. Cyrus the Restless, the protagonist of a minigame, the Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, comes to this realm to save the soul of his sister- a task he succeeds in. Curiously, in the most recent Eras, the realm has become more like a prison, for a being known as Umbra- who is a sentient part of Clavicus Vile.</p5>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/fields of regret.png" alt ="an image of the fields of regret"></div>
            <h3 id="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</h3>
            <p6>The realm of Hermaeus Mora, Apocrypha is heavily featured in the DLC for Skyrim, known as Dragonborn. It is accessed via artifacts known as Black Books- books of forbidden knowledge. The lands are everchanging, like it's patron. The land is an oily sea of green ink, with ink-like tentacles occasionally rising from it to strike at anything near. The land itself is akin to a cathedral of stone, with books built into the walls- the floor is akin to pages, and very web-like bridges take you between each area. It is a realm of knowledge- everything it's patron has learnt.</p6>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/ApocryphaScene.png" alt ="an image of Apocrypha"></div>
            <h3 id="Hunt">Hunting Grounds</h3>
            <p7>The Hunting Grounds belong to the Daedric Lord Hircine. It's written as being an endless amount of puzzling rooms- bears, wolves, Daedra, and various were-creatures. The idea of the place is being a land of eternal hunt- with Hircine being the Lord of the Hunt. The land is mostly densewoodland, and grasslands- a large scape for hunting</p7>

            <h3 id="Ash">Ashpit</h3>
            <p8>The Ashpit is the realm of Malacath- one of the few that is not solid. Malacath represents emptiness, and his realm keeps that same design- there is no floor, there is no sky, and there is no air. Instead, it as an endless nothing, with dust, ash and smoke filling everything. It is easily the hardest realm to reach- of those mortals can even reach, and death is guaranteed if you have no form of breathing. Orcs, who worship Malacath, believe that the realm hides a paradise for their kind- though this is disputed</p8>

            <h3 id="Dead">Deadlands</h3>
            <p9>The Deadlands are the most visited of all the planes, being the main plane of Oblivion you enter during the 4th installment- the titular plane. It is the realm of Mehrunes Dagon, and represents destruction. Lava, smoke and molten rock dot the landscape, with dark shadows filling every corner. Almost everything is lethal in this land, and it serves as a reminder of it's patrons evil nature</p9>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/OblivionOrig.jpg" alt ="An image of the Deadlands"></div>
            <h3 id="Skein">Spiral Skein</h3>
            <p10>The Spiral Skein is a realm that mortals simply cannot reach- as Mephala doesn't want them too. It is a large, woven web, surrounding a tall tower- the Pillar Palace of Mephala. Between the tower and the web, there are 8 columns- each one representing a sin- lies, envy, seduction, dread, betrayal, murder and avarice- with the final one representing death.</p10>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/Mephala%27s_Web.png" alt ="An image of the Spiral Skein"></div>
            <h3 id="Rooms">Colored Rooms</h3>
            <p11>The Colored Rooms are the realms of Meridia, and house the Aurorans- Meridia's personal Daedra. Very little is known of the area, though it's been seen once, in Elder Scrolls Online. It is a large collection of floating rocks and islands, with a wispy blue mist spreading across the area- with bright lights around, representing the bright lights of Meridia- the Daedric Lord of Light</p11>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/Colored_Rooms.png" alt ="An image of the colored rooms"></div>
            <h3 id="Cold">Coldharbour</h3>
            <p12>Coldharbour is Molag Bal's domain, and is incredibly inhospitable to mortalkind. The ground is sludge- the sky is fire, and yet the air is cold. The most famous part of Coldharbour is a copy of the Imperial City- capital of Cyrodiil, though twisted- blood running through it's halls, and corpses dotting the landscape. Anyone who enters Coldharbor, while mortal, is destined for enslavement, to become one of the Soul Shriven- slaves that work away, under Molag Bal's command.</p12>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/ESO_Coldharbour_View_1.png" alt ="An image of Coldharbour"></div>
            <h3 id="Void">Scuttling Void</h3>
            <p13>The Scuttling Void is ruled by Namira, and is almost completely unknown- the only facts detailed about the area is a cold nature, and that no one who enters ever returns.</p13>

            <h3 id="Ever">Evergloam</h3>
            <p14>Evergloam is the domain of Nocturnal, and is a dark, shadowy land- rolling fog covering the landscape, and gloomy creatures within it's mists. The Nightingales are destined to live their afterlife around here, protecting the Skeleton Key, an artifact of Nocturnal, from ever being taken</p14>

            <h3 id="Pits">The Pits</h3>
            <p15>Peryite rules over The Pits- not to be mistaken with the Ashpits. No mortal can go to the Pits- though no one would want too either way. Peryite is oft considered the weakest Daedric Lord, and it reflects in his realm- housing only the weakest of all daedra</p15>

            <h3 id="Revelry">Myriad Realms of Revelry</h3>
            <p16>The Myriad Realms of Revelry belong to Sanguine- and is a strange area. Instead of being a larger realm, like the rest, it is a further collection of thousands upon thousands of other realms, and Sanguine allows any of his guests to customise their pocket to their own will. Sanguine is very polite- and doesn't enforce his control over the grand collection. The Dragonborn- protagonist of Skyrim- visits the Misty Grove, one of these realms, when he meets Sanguine.</p16>
            <br><div class="image"><img class="image" src="Images/Misty_Grove_Scenery.jpg" alt ="an image of the misty grove, a part of the myriad realms"></div>
            <h3 id="Isles">Shivering Isles</h3>
            <p17>The Shivering Isles is the second most common plane- visited an awful lot during Oblivion, in the DLC for Oblivion, with the same name. It is the domain of Sheogorath (and Jyggalag), with a complicated history. In the current era, it is a realm of pure insanity- it takes the apperance of a world where things are simply...wrong- people act differently, and things don't make sense. Jyggalag used to rule over the realm- before he became Sheogorath. Once the two split into different entities, the Shivering Isles remained under Sheogorath.</p17>

            <h3 id="Quagmire">Quagmire</h3>
            <p18>Quagmire, or the Dreamstride, is a realm of nightmares, ruled by Vaermina. It is a mystifying place, that constantly changes- with each strike of lightning it changes to a new nightmare- from being buried alive in a casket, to losing your loved ones. Vaermina, like most Daedric Princes, is not a nice person, and her realm reflects this greatly- bringing out your deepest nightmares when you arrive</p18>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 id="Lesser">The Realms of Oblivion- Lesser</h2>
            <p19>The lesser planes are those not controlled by a Daedric Lord, but something- or someone, else. There are very few examples of these given- only two named in the entire series.</p19>

            <h3 id="Paradise">Gaiar Alata</h3>
            <p20>Gaiar Alata, or Paradise, is a realm created by Mankar Cameron- a devout servant of Mehrunes Dagon. Paradise was designed to be just that, a paradise for the people that live within it. In truth, it hid a dark secret- anyone not part of Mankar's inner circle was tortured, and abused by various Daedra. The inner circle only consisted of family- so most followers met this fate</p20>

            <h3 id="Soul">Soul Cairn</h3>
            <p21>The Soul Cairn is made by a group called the 'Ideal Masters'. Nothing is known about this group- but they made a deal with the Daedra to create the realm. Whenever someone is sealed in a Black Soul Gem, they are eternally trapped here- a limbo, for lost souls, for experiments and torture by the Ideal Masters, and their whims.</p21>
