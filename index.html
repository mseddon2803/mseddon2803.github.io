    <h1>The Elder Scrolls - The Realm of Oblivion</h1>

        <h2>Game Bio</h2>
        <p1 class="para">The Elder Scrolls is a series of ARPGS- Action Role Playing Games- developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and published by Bethesda Softworks. The setting is a high-fantasy world, with inspiration from real life- the Imperial Empire, a large faction within the game, takes heavy inspiration from the Roman Empire, as an example. The franchise has many realms within the framework of it's lore- namely Mundus, Aetherius and Oblivion, the franchises parallels to Earth, Heaven and Hell respectively. This site will talk about the realm of Oblivion, and it's inner workings.</p1>

        <h2>Website Reasons</h2>
        <p2 class="para">The lore of the Elder Scrolls is a fragmented mess, in the politest way possible- each game retcons the previous in multiple ways, lore is written by multiple writers in short stories with little care for keeping the overall structure and lore 'clean'- leading to many contradictions and decisions. Deciding which part to do was difficult- the Elder Scrolls has many interesting lore points, from the Dwemer and how they (possibly) mantled Lorkhan, the ascension of Talos, CHIM as a concept, and the continent of Akivir, alluded too- but never visited, I believe that the realm of Oblivion is the most interesting- a realm designed to emulate Hell, yet shown to not be pure evil, and instead representing the Gods who simply wanted nothing to do with mortals in the beginning. Due to the importance of Oblivion to the stories of the games, it is often visited far more, and more details are known then the mysterious Aetherius- visited just once, and the Void- only ever mentioned in passing.  </p2>

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p class="para">My name is Matthew Seddon- someone who has grown up on The Elder Scrolls. Oblivion, the 4th installment of the game, was released on March 20th, 2006, when I was almost 4 years old. It was around 2009 when my brother picked up the game and began playing it. At the time I was 7, and instantly enjoyed watching the game- although a few years had passed, no game captivated me like Oblivion did, due to it's method of storytelling- and a shared interest with my brother, who I never had a strong relationship with. While it is not a perfect game, and holds many flaws, as does the series itself, Oblivion holds a special place in my heart for helping solidfy my relationship with my brother- which goes very strongly to this day. Even as I've grown up- from the 7 year old to a 19 year old, I have played through the various games multiple times, alone, with my brother, or with friends, and can truly say it has shaped by taste in fiction. I decided to make this website for that reason- a small fanproject to celebrate a game that has indirectly shaped who I am </p>

        <h2>Research Experiences</h2>
        <p class="para">As is a given for a task of this size, in which you write a lot of text about something like this, research was required. The sad truth is that research was probably not required, as I have done this many times before in my life, and enjoy the lore of this game, though less as an avid reader, and more in the same way you watch a car crash. Now, as a disclaimer, I like the lore of the Elder Scrolls. As stated above, I am a massive fan of the games, and I can even say it's written well, in individual pieces. This section is not necessarily dedicated to anything Daedric related- just more like a written down rant of how the lore of the Elder Scrolls is stupid. For example, a town known as Cropsford is being built within The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. At the start, it is a single building, with a quest- and every few weeks after, you can see the town grow into more buildings. A neat little side quest. The 4th installment of the game is set at the tail end of the 3rd Era, with the end of the main story beginning the 4th Era in the lore. Elder Scrolls online is set in the 2nd era- however, during ESO, your character can visit Cropsford, a very sprawling town. Approximately, at absolute minimum, 433 years before it's creation. Magic, no? The second game in the franchise, Daggerfall, involves the Eternal Champion, the protagonist, going through multiple endings involving the Numidium, a large brass automaton designed to be a god. They had to decide which ending was canon- so of course, all of them were. Your character, exactly at the same time, 1. Vanishes. 2. Gives the Numidium to the Underking, a lich, 3. Gives the Numidium to the King of Worms, an evil wizard, 4. Gives the Numidium to Orsinium 5. Gives the Numidium to Daggerfall 6. Gives the Numidium to Wayrest and finally, 7. Gives the Numidium to Sentinel. How are all of these explained has having happened, simulatenously, with no extra effects? Why, "they just do", of course! Maddening.</p>
        <p class="para"><br>Of course, it doesn't stop there. In what I consider the stupidest lore concept is CHIM. Of course, there has to be an explanation for Men to become gods, or the entire history of Skyrim is rendered obsolete, as is Cyrodiil. For both those two countries to even exist, our reverent god, Talos, must ascend from his mortality as Talos Stormcrown. He does this through something known as CHIM. CHIM is in the Ehlnofex long, and translates to Starlight, or royalty, or high splendor, and probably about 50 other words that the writers couldn't decide on. CHIM is achieved by staring down the Tower, a representation of Aurbis itself, the entire universe. If you can stare down the Tower, and retain your individuality, and find out your true purpose, you ascend to divinity. If you fail to figure out your individuality, you are simply erased from the universe, in something known as a "Zero Sum". How do we know you get Zero Summed, if anyone who it happens too is erased from history? Who knows! CHIM has been obtained by only 2 known people. Vivec, and Talos. Vivec achieved it by marrying Molag Bal, and was apparently inspired about it, and wrote about it. How Molag Bal knows is unknown, likely "because Daedra" is the answer. How Talos did it is even less explained- he just simply <bold>does</bold> it, removes the jungles from Cyrodiil, then becomes a god. Hang on, I thought those who achieved CHIM were higher then gods- why does he become lower? Again, my dear reader, don't ask questions. Even the writers do not know!</p>
        <p class="para"><br>In a less annoying one, the Elder Scrolls themselves are such an unbelievable enigma, that i'm not sure the writers even know what to do with them. In the lore of the game, the Elder Scrolls are scrolls that are old. Shocker. They have an unknown origin, and detail everything that will happen, has happened, and is happening. They exceed the power of both Aedra and Daedra, so something beyond created them. That's all fine, a bit of mystery is always acceptable. Reading an Elder Scroll permanently renders the reader blind, and likely insane- unless they do the proper preperations. Again, understandable- elder magic that no one truly understands. The Dwemer have created an artifact called the Lexicon, which allows you to read an Elder Scroll safely. The Dwemer obviously being the catch-all for "technology did it", this can be considered acceptable, at least to me. All of this is fine. It makes some sense, even if it's a little silly, silliness comes with fantasy franchises. However, there are already some inconsistencies. No known magic can change recorded history- you simply can't change something in the past. Yet, in Oblivion's quest for the Thieves Guild...you use an Elder Scroll to erase the past. So an Elder Scroll can change itself at will, if you want. If that's true- why bother with magic, if you can just remove the past for no reason. If that ISN'T true, then how do some random people from a Thieves Guild do it? The Grey Fox is no one special at the time- literally just a city count. But, okay, let's assume that Nocturnal, the patron of theives, has a hand. The most annoying part to me is contained within Skyrim. Dawnguard, the DLC, requires 3 Elder Scrolls to be read by Dexion, a Moth Priest. He goes blind after reading the first in a hurry, requiring the Dragonborn to go perform a ritual. However, one of these Elder Scrolls is the main stories Dragon Scroll, which details the Dragon Crisis, and is read in the main story. With the help of the Lexicon. Which you have. Proving you can read it. For some reason, you perform some inane ritual at some strange location you've never heard of, and get details of things you've already got the ability to read. This is never explained, nor even mentioned, for some infuriating reason.</p>
        <p class="para"><br>I'm not 100% out of rants to do with inconsistencies, but I don't want to take up more space on the page. Excuse me for being rather meta with this, on a website designed to be more about the Daedra, but the inconsistencies of the general plot is incredibly annoying, and reading over it all for the sake of research has been annoying. Anyway, dear reader, I thank you for reading my website! I hope you have a nice day, whatever day that may be. And if this is read by the future Matthew, keep your head up! The lore cannot harm you, friend. It can only cause severe, irreperable anger issues. I'm only half joking.</p>
